# Progress

## What Works
- All core Memory Bank files have been updated to reference the NFS Big5 assessment and the new logo asset location in the `images` directory.
- Branding customization plan is aligned with the NFS Big5 brand and asset management strategy.
- Custom markdown processing solution successfully implemented, replacing contentlayer.
- **MongoDB Atlas migration is complete and verified.** The application successfully connects to MongoDB Atlas using environment variables.
- **Netlify "page not found" error resolved by configuring build settings (base directory and build command) in `netlify.toml`.**
- **Application refactored for English-only support:**
    - i18n configuration (`site.config.ts`, `middleware.ts`) updated.
    - Non-English message files removed.
    - Locale switcher components removed and Navbar updated.
- **Catch-all route (`[[...rest]]/page.tsx`) confirmed to have `generateStaticParams` suitable for English-only static export.**
- **English-only refactor and `generateStaticParams` fix committed and pushed.**

## What's Left to Build
- **Investigate and resolve persistent conflicting catch-all route error locally.**
- Monitor Netlify deployment for build success.
- Implement branding changes in the codebase using assets from `images`.
- Update UI, config, and documentation to consistently use "NFS Big5".
- Expand documentation as new features or requirements emerge.
- **Complete Netlify Edge Function implementation:**
    - Enable MongoDB Data API in Atlas (manual).
    - Add required environment variables to Netlify site settings (manual).
    - Test Edge Function locally using `netlify dev`.
    - Integrate Edge Function calls into Next.js API routes if needed.
    - Deploy and validate Edge Function in production.

## Current Status
- Documentation is up to date with the NFS Big5 brand and asset management approach.
- Project is ready for further customization and deployment.
- Dependency conflicts with Next.js 14 resolved by migrating from contentlayer to custom markdown utilities.
- **MongoDB Atlas is successfully integrated and verified.**
- **Initial Netlify Edge Function file and configuration created.**
- **`.env.local` has been removed from Git history using `git-filter-repo` to prevent exposure of sensitive information.**
- **English-only refactor and `generateStaticParams` fix committed and pushed.**
- **Netlify deployment is configured for static export, and we are monitoring the build result.**
- **Debugging persistent conflicting catch-all route error locally.**
- **Installed Babel dependencies (`@babel/core`, `@babel/preset-react`)** to address ESLint parsing error.

## Known Issues
- **Persistent local development error:** "You cannot use both an required and optional catch-all route at the same level ("[...rest]" and "[[...rest]]" )". This error persists despite attempting to remove the `[...rest]` directory and removing `output: 'export'`. Investigation is ongoing.
- **ESLint Parsing error:** "Cannot find module 'next/babel'". Addressed by installing Babel dependencies.
- **Netlify build error: Missing generateStaticParams for /[locale]/[...rest] route when using `output: 'export'`.** This error is no longer relevant since `output: 'export'` was removed.
- No other major issues identified at this stage; documentation will be updated as the project evolves.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Shifted all branding and documentation to use "NFS Big5"
- Centralized logo and brand assets in the `images` directory for easier management
- Documentation-first approach to support future development and onboarding
- Migrated from third-party content management (contentlayer) to custom solution for better control and compatibility
- **Decided to use Netlify Edge Functions with MongoDB Data API for low-latency database access in production.**
- **Configured Next.js for static export (`output: 'export'`) and updated Netlify redirects to address initial deployment issues.**
- **Decided to refactor the application to support English only** to simplify deployment and maintenance.
