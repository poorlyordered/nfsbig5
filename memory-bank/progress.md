# Progress

## What Works
- All core Memory Bank files have been updated to reference the NFS Big5 assessment and the new logo asset location in the `images` directory
- Branding customization plan is aligned with the NFS Big5 brand and asset management strategy
- Project structure supports modularity, internationalization, and white-label deployment
- Custom markdown processing solution successfully implemented, replacing contentlayer
- **MongoDB Atlas migration is complete and verified.** The application successfully connects to MongoDB Atlas using environment variables.

## What's Left to Build
- Implement and test branding changes in the codebase using assets from `images`
- Update UI, config, and documentation to consistently use "NFS Big5"
- Expand documentation as new features or requirements emerge
- **Complete Netlify Edge Function implementation:**
    - Enable MongoDB Data API in Atlas (manual).
    - Add required environment variables to Netlify site settings (manual).
    - Test Edge Function locally using `netlify dev`.
    - Integrate Edge Function calls into Next.js API routes if needed.
    - Deploy and validate Edge Function in production.

## Current Status
- Documentation is up to date with the NFS Big5 brand and asset management approach
- Project is ready for further customization and deployment
- Dependency conflicts with Next.js 14 resolved by migrating from contentlayer to custom markdown utilities
- **MongoDB Atlas is successfully integrated and verified.**
- **Initial Netlify Edge Function file and configuration created.**
- **`.env.local` has been removed from Git history using `git-filter-repo` to prevent exposure of sensitive information.**

## Known Issues
- No major issues identified at this stage; documentation will be updated as the project evolves

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Shifted all branding and documentation to use "NFS Big5"
- Centralized logo and brand assets in the `images` directory for easier management
- Documentation-first approach to support future development and onboarding
- Migrated from third-party content management (contentlayer) to custom solution for better control and compatibility
- **Decided to use Netlify Edge Functions with MongoDB Data API for low-latency database access in production.**
